# Teksperanto

A very very basic Esperanto text editor. There is also a dictionary built in, that can search by English or Esperanto words. A fuzzy search is done unless the word is enclosed in single quotes. In that case, a literal search is performed.

## Why?

It makes typing Esperanto characters easier.

## How?

For Esperanto letters that have accent characters, type an 'x' after the character. A substitor thread periodically runs and replaces these combo characters with their unicode representations.
